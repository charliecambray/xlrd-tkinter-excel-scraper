*****Charlie's Freelancer Helper (version 0.2)*****

This is a little tool written in python to grab data from
the excel file “hf_pp2.xls”.

I wrote this to help look for freelancers as
the current excel spreadsheet is far too painful to scroll through.

With this program you are able to: search for a freelancer by name. Or update the freelancer list by discipline (or multiple disciplines).

Please note this program does not store any data. Nor may you edit the excel spreadsheet data. This program just references the spreadsheet and presents the data in a cleaner way.

You are fine to update the spreadsheet with new freelancers. I have set up this program to allow up to a limit of 1000 total freelancers. This is to save on proccesing power as I want this to be a really quick program. If you do go over 1000 freelancers, I salute you.

Please be aware that critical edits to the spreadsheet's structure such as changing columns may break this tool. 



*****Getting Started*****

Place this exe in the same directory or folder as the spreadsheet with the name of “hf_pp2.xls". Alternatively if you copy this excel spreadsheet to the same directory or folder as the exe/app it will have the same result.
